### On-demand Self-Service:
- The first characteristic of cloud computing is that it is an on-demand, typically self service model. On-demand, meaning that it can be purchased when needed, for as long as needed, and given back when finished
- Self service refers to the consumer's ability to buy, deploy and shut down services without any assistance from the service provider

### Ubiquitous Network Access:
- Anything referred to as-a-service requires a network connection. How would it be accessed, managed, operated, or utilized without some network connection, typically to the internet using standard protocols that promote use by disparate client platforms? Because the cloud is an always-on and always-accessible offering, users have immediate access to all available resources, and assets

### Location Transparent Resource Pooling:
- The third characteristic, resource pooling, is the characteristic that, in essence, lies at the heart of all that is good about cloud computing.
  Combining many smaller compute resources into farms or pools that can serve many consumers simultaneously enables dynamic resource allocation and re-allocation, cost predictability, IT resource control, and higher rates of infrastructure utilization.
  Utilization and consumption patterns directly affect cost.
  Resource pooling enables different physical and virtual resources to be allocated and re-allocated according to consumer demand.

### Rapid Elasticity:
- The ability to dynamically match the need.
- Product and service capabilities are developed, acquired, priced, and provisioned elastically, enabling rapid response to continuously changing user demand.
  To the consumer, capabilities often appear unlimited and easily deployed in any quantity at any time. Because cloud services utilize a consumption-based pay-per-use model, you only pay for what you use.
  
### Measured Service with Pay-per-Use:
- Cloud computing natively offers a unique and important component that traditional IT deployments have struggled to provide—measurement and control of resource consumption and utilization.
  As mentioned often, billing was the big innovation. Cloud resource consumption needed to be measured and billed for accurately.
  Once that was possible, the true power of the cloud, which included the ability to shut it off, was realized.
  The capability enabled automated reporting, monitoring, and alerting which provided much-needed transparency between the provider and the client.
