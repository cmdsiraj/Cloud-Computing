# Types of Cloud Services
## 1. Infrastructe as a Service (IaaS)
- Delivery of fundamental computing resources, virtualized hardware, storage, and networking.
- **How it Works**
  - User rent IT infrastructre as pay-as-you-go basis
  - Provider manages the physical hardware while users manage the operating systems and applications.

## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Paas builds on top of IaaS.
- Cloud Computing model that allows user to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with underlying infrastructure.
- **How it Works**
  - Providers offer hardware, software tools, and hosting.
  - Developers focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management.

## Difference between On-premises and Cloud Services
### On-premises
- Infrastructure is owned and managed by the organization.
- Required hight Capital Expenditure (CapEx) for the hardware and setup.
- Scalability is limited by physical capacity and current infrastructure.
- Maintainance, Security and upgrades are maintained in-house.
- Deployment is slower and requires extensive planning and physical setup.
## Cloud
- Cloud infrastructure is rented and managed externally.
- It uses pay-as-you-go model to lower the upfront costs.
- provides nearly unlimited scalability with on-demand resources.
- The cloud provider automatically manages maintenance and upgrades/
- Enables rapid deployment and flexible resource management to quickly adapt to demand changes.
